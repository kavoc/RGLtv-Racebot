# RGLtv-Racebot
Discord bot used for timing and recording speedrun races

In order to use this bot, you must register a new application with Discord.  This can be done at https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me.  Discord will then provide you with an OAuth token that needs to be written in the racebot.ini file.
